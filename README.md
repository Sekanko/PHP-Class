# PHP class documentation

## 📄Description
This repository contains a selected collection of PHP class assignments 
completed as part of my programming coursework. 
They serve as a demonstration of my experience and basic
familiarity with PHP.

If you're interested in reviewing the code, I particularly recommend the following:
- 🍪 Zestaw 11 / Zad 5 - **Cookies Manager**
- 🚗 Zestaw 12 / Zad 10 - **Car Service**
